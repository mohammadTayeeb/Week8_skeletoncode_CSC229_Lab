    /*The time complexity of binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the size of the array.
    This is because in each iteration of the algorithm, the size of the subarray to search in is reduced by half.
    Therefore, the number of iterations required to find the element is log2(n).
    The space complexity of binary search algorithm is O(1), as it only requires a few constant-sized variables
    to keep track of the subarray bounds and the index of the element.*/
